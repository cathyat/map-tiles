# GEOG 458 Lab 4: Map Tiles
**AI DISCLOSURE**: I used AI in this assignment for: *debugging*. I did not use AI to write or complete any components where AI use is prohibited. 
- Reason for debugging: My map layers for each tile set were not rendering nor showing up on my live view even though my code was complete so I was really confused. I used AI to help me debug and it told me that I misplaced the location of my final curly brace.

- **Examined Geographic Area**: Centered on city of Seattle however it does include areas in Bellevue, Renton, and Tukwila.
- **Available Zoom Levels**: 11-15
- **Brief Description**: I focused on the city of Seattle because I tend to use the open sourced government data a lot, so I figure it would be useful to make map tiles for Seattle. I used a classic dark map and played around with the road colors and label fonts to achieve this look. 

## My Favorite Cafes Tile Set 2:
